## Architecture decisions

1. **Single platform: Android.** Samsung Voice Recorder integration, AnkiDroid intents, scoped-storage
   access, and background work are all Android-specific. iOS is explicitly **out of scope for v1**
   (NFR-2.3.1 keeps the core portable, but we are not shipping iOS). Min OS **Android API 26 (8.0)**.
2. **Flutter + Riverpod + Drift.** Feature-first under
   `lib/features/<feature>/{presentation,application,data,domain}`. Drift (SQLite + SQLCipher) is the
   single source of truth — **no backend, no sync, no auth**. Repositories wrap a local datasource behind
   an abstract seam so a remote could be added later, but none exists now.
3. **Offline-first, not offline-only.** All core engines run offline. Exactly two features need network:
   **Fal.ai image generation** (FR-1.3.4) and **SMTP email reports** (FR-1.5.3). Both run behind a
   **connectivity-gated service seam** with a persistent **offline queue** drained by a
   `workmanager`-style background worker on reconnect (NFR-2.1.3).
4. **Anki via AnkiDroid intents, on-device.** Not AnkiConnect (that's HTTP-to-desktop and breaks
   offline-first). We use AnkiDroid's `com.ichi2.anki` intents to create decks, note types, and notes
   directly on the device. Requires AnkiDroid installed; we detect + gracefully degrade with a clear
   "install AnkiDroid" CTA if absent.
5. **AI images via Fal.ai.** Provider pinned. Per-word cache (an Uzbek word is generated at most once),
   connectivity-gated, skipped offline (Type 2 card shows a placeholder until generated). Key via
   `--dart-define`; no key in the repo.
6. **Weekly report via SMTP.** Background send, queued + drained on reconnect. SMTP creds + recipient
   configured via `--dart-define` / in-app settings; never in the repo. Report rendered as styled HTML.
7. **Business logic is pure Dart.** GPA interval math, vocab parsing, queue scheduling, metric
   aggregation — all testable without a device or emulator.
8. **Encrypted local DB (SQLCipher) by default** (NFR-2.4.2). Recordings are sensitive cultural content.
9. **Review completion is an append-only event log, not a flag.** A `review_events` table records one
   row per completed milestone (recording id, milestone index, completed-at). "Reviewed for milestone N",
   "last reviewed", and "review count" are all **derived** from this log — no boolean column to keep in
   sync, and the same log feeds the M6 "Completed Queue items" metric. Replaying the same milestone
   appends a new event (a user can review the same interval more than once); the *active* milestone is
   still the next-unreached one.
10. **No monetization in v1.** No IAP, no paywall, no RemoteConfig. Scope creep into billing is explicitly
   out of scope.
10. **v1 cut = all six milestones.** M1–M3 form the daily-use core; M4–M6 add automation + insight. All
    six ship before "sellable".

## COMPLETE Milestone 1: Core Audio Sync & Native Playback

**Objective:** Index and play existing local recordings with zero fluff. FR-1.1.x, NFR-2.2.1/2.2.2.

### User stories
* As a learner, I want the app to scan my device for my Samsung Voice Recorder folder on first launch so
  I don't manually import historical audio.
* As a learner, I want a clean, premium list of all indexed recordings.
* As a learner, I want to tap and play any recording instantly with standard controls (play/pause/seek).

### Acceptance criteria
* On first install, the user is prompted with a native folder picker to select/confirm their Samsung Voice
  Recorder path (scoped-storage / SAF compliant).
* The app indexes all `.m4a`/`.mp3`/`.wav` in the designated directory off the main isolate without
  freezing the UI (≤1000 files in <2.0s — NFR-2.2.1).
* Playback works offline with native media-session controls and audio-focus management (FR-1.1.4).
* UI matches the premium visual bar (typography, contrast, transitions) — `/design-review` ≥4/5.

### Tickets
- **T1.1 — Storage permissions + folder picker.** Runtime perms + SAF folder selection for the Samsung
  Voice Recorder directory; persist the chosen URI. *ACs:* FR-1.1.1 (picker). *Deps:* T0.2.
- **T1.2 — Audio indexer.** Scan the designated dir, read metadata (creation date, name, size, format),
  upsert into the `recordings` table off the main isolate. *ACs:* FR-1.1.1, FR-1.1.2, NFR-2.2.1.
  *Deps:* T1.1.
- **T1.3 — Startup rescan.** On app start, re-scan and reconcile (add new, keep existing, soft-mark
  missing). *ACs:* FR-1.1.1 (subsequent startups). *Deps:* T1.2.
- **T1.4 — Recordings list screen.** Premium list of indexed recordings (name, date, duration),
  empty/loading/error states, i18n strings. *ACs:* M1 story 2, NFR-2.4.1, NFR-2.5.x. *Deps:* T1.2.
- **T1.5 — Audio player + media session.** `just_audio` + `audio_service`, play/pause/seek, background
  playback, audio focus (pause on call). *ACs:* FR-1.1.4, NFR-2.2.2. *Deps:* T1.4.
- **T1.6 — Recording detail screen.** Tap a recording → detail with player + metadata. *ACs:* M1 story 3.
  *Deps:* T1.5.

## COMPLETE Milestone 2: GPA Scheduler & In-App Capturing

**Objective:** Turn static audio into a structured GPA review pipeline. FR-1.2.x.

### User stories
* As a learner, I want recordings auto-placed into a daily "Due for Review" list by the strict interval
  sequence (1, 2, 4, 7, 30, 90, 180, 365 days) so I stay on top of my listening library.
* As a learner, I want to record new audio in-app that saves into the shared Samsung folder so it's
  instantly indexed.

### Acceptance criteria
* Home screen shows a dynamic "Today's Review Queue" computed from creation dates + GPA intervals.
* A 1-day-stale recording is shown and marked stale; the stale prompt disappears on the 2nd stale day.
* Queue items are playable with one tap; crossing 80% playback appends a review event, marking that
  milestone reviewed (derived from the event log).
* The recording detail screen shows the review history: last reviewed, milestone reached, review count.
* An in-app "Record" button captures audio and exports it to the indexed folder (and it's indexed on next
  scan).

### Tickets
- **T2.1 — GPA interval engine (pure Dart).** Given creation date + now, compute due milestones over
  `1,2,4,7,30,90,180,365`. *ACs:* FR-1.2.1, FR-1.2.2. *Deps:* T0.2. (Pure-Dart, fully unit-tested.)
- **T2.2 — Review-event log.** A `review_events` table (recording id, milestone index, completed-at) +
  repository. Appending an event when playback crosses 80%. "Reviewed for milestone N" derived from the
  log, not stored as a flag. *ACs:* FR-1.2.3. *Deps:* T0.2, T1.5.
- **T2.3 — Review-history derivation.** Pure-Dart queries over `review_events`: last-reviewed date,
  milestone reached, review count, active (next-unreached) milestone per recording. *ACs:* FR-1.2.4.
  *Deps:* T2.2. (Pure-Dart, unit-tested.)
- **T2.4 — Today's queue + stale rule.** Compute today's due set (active milestone due today); mark
  1-day-stale; suppress on 2nd stale day. *ACs:* FR-1.2.5, M2 AC 1–2. *Deps:* T2.1, T2.3.
- **T2.5 — Home / queue screen.** "Today's Review Queue", one-tap play, stale badge. *ACs:* M2 AC 3,
  NFR-2.4.1. *Deps:* T2.4, T1.6.
- **T2.6 — Recording detail: review history.** On the recording detail screen, show last-reviewed
  date, milestone reached, and review count (derived from `review_events`). *ACs:* FR-1.2.4, NFR-2.4.1.
  *Deps:* T1.6, T2.3.
- **T2.7 — In-app recorder.** `record` package; save to the designated Samsung dir; trigger rescan.
  *ACs:* FR-1.1.3, M2 AC 4. *Deps:* T1.3.

## COMPLETE Milestone 3: Languaculture Word Log & Visual Attachments

**Objective:** Bridge audio with vocabulary data and visual media (GPA "Word Log"). FR-1.3.1/1.3.2.

### User stories
* As a learner, I want to attach a raw text list or a photo of my vocabulary sheet to a recording.
* As a learner, I want the associated text/image log shown contextually while that recording plays.

### Acceptance criteria
* The player screen shows a toggle panel for the associated text log or attached photo(s).
* Mapping persists offline via the local Drift store.
* Schema links one text log and/or multiple image files to one recording.

### tickets
- **T3.1 — Word-log schema + repository.** `word_logs` table; one text log and/or multiple images per
  recording; abstract repo seam. *ACs:* FR-1.3.1, NFR-2.1.2. *Deps:* T0.2.
- **T3.2 — Text-log attach + parsing.** Attach a text log; parse English↔Uzbek pairs via `:` / `-`
  delimiters into structured pairs. *ACs:* FR-1.3.2. *Deps:* T3.1. (Pure-Dart parser, unit-tested.)
- **T3.3 — Image-log attach.** Attach JPG/PNG notebook photos to a recording (SAF copy into app data).
  *ACs:* FR-1.3.1 (images). *Deps:* T3.1.
- **T3.4 — Word-log viewer panel.** Toggle panel on the player screen: text log or image(s).
  *ACs:* M3 AC 1, NFR-2.4.1. *Deps:* T1.6, T3.2, T3.3.

---

## COMPLETE Milestone 4: Anki Generation & AI Image Engine

**Objective:** Push vocab to Anki and generate concept-image cards. FR-1.3.3/1.3.4.

### User stories
* As a learner, I want the app to scan my text vocab list, extract English/Uzbek pairs, and inject them
  into Anki via a localized deck tagged with the recording name.
* As a learner, I want each card to feature a direct translation card and a separate AI-generated image
  card representing the Uzbek word.

### Acceptance criteria
* Saving a text vocab list auto-generates flashcards in AnkiDroid via its intent API, tagged with the
  recording filename. Requires AnkiDroid installed; graceful "install AnkiDroid" CTA if absent.
* Flashcard layout: Type 1 (English ↔ Uzbek) and Type 2 (AI concept image → Uzbek).
* AI image generation is **Fal.ai**, queued + drained on reconnect, cached per Uzbek word, skipped when
  offline (Type 2 shows a placeholder until ready).

### Tickets
- **T4.1 — AnkiDroid intent adapter.** Platform channel / intent to create deck, note type (Type 1 + Type
  2), and notes via `com.ichi2.anki`; detect install + degrade gracefully. *ACs:* FR-1.3.3. *Deps:* T3.2.
- **T4.2 — Type 1 card generation.** Map parsed pairs → AnkiDroid Type 1 notes, tagged by recording
  filename; idempotent (re-saving doesn't duplicate). *ACs:* FR-1.3.3, M4 AC 2 (Type 1). *Deps:* T4.1.
- **T4.3 — Fal.ai image service (abstract seam).** `AIImageService` interface; Fal.ai impl; per-word
  cache; enqueue + drain on reconnect; placeholder when offline/pending. *ACs:* FR-1.3.4, NFR-2.1.3.
  *Deps:* T0.3.
- **T4.4 — Type 2 card generation.** For each Uzbek word with no cached image, enqueue generation, then
  attach to AnkiDroid Type 2 note. *ACs:* FR-1.3.4, M4 AC 2 (Type 2), M4 AC 3. *Deps:* T4.2, T4.3.
- **T4.5 — Anki export flow UI.** "Send to Anki" action on a recording's word log; status + retry on
  failure; offline-queue visibility. *ACs:* M4 AC 1, NFR-2.4.1. *Deps:* T4.4.

---

## COMPLETE Milestone 5: Task Management, Coaching Repository & Notifications

**Objective:** Actionable dashboard for learning targets + live coaching sessions. FR-1.4.x.

### User stories
* As a learner, I want to create custom exercises (e.g. "Memorize 'Yor-Yor'") with deadlines and get
  native notifications when due.
* As a learner, I want a structured bank of conversation topics, questions, and scripts for coaching
  sessions.

### Acceptance criteria
* "Exercises & Tasks" view: create, set due date, checkbox-complete.
* Local notifications fire accurately on due dates even when the app is closed.
* "Coach Bank" saves text notes and links existing recordings / vocab words as talking points.

### tickets
- **T5.1 — Tasks schema + repository.** `tasks` table (title, description, due date, completed); repo.
  *ACs:* FR-1.4.1. *Deps:* T0.2.
- **T5.2 — Tasks screen.** Create / edit / complete / delete; due-date picker; empty states.
  *ACs:* FR-1.4.1, NFR-2.4.1. *Deps:* T5.1.
- **T5.3 — Scheduled notifications.** `flutter_local_notifications` + `android_alarm_manager_plus`;
  schedule on due date; fire when app closed; exact-alarm permission flow. *ACs:* FR-1.4.2, M5 AC 2.
  *Deps:* T5.1.
- **T5.4 — Coach Bank schema + repository.** `coach_notes` table; link recordings / vocab words as talking
  points. *ACs:* FR-1.4.3. *Deps:* T0.2.
- **T5.5 — Coach Bank screen.** Create/edit notes, attach recordings/vocab, agenda view for a session.
  *ACs:* FR-1.4.3, NFR-2.4.1. *Deps:* T5.4, T1.6.

---

## Milestone 6: Analytics Dashboard & Automated Email Reports (T6.1–T6.6 done)

**Objective:** Aesthetic summary of consistency. FR-1.5.x.

### User stories
* As a learner, I want a beautifully visualized dashboard: lesson hours, journaling minutes, reviews
  completed, flashcards cleared.
* As a learner, I want an automated weekly summary email of my learning trajectory.

### Acceptance criteria
* Statistics view renders native charts tracking daily/weekly/monthly metrics.
* Counters increment behind the scenes from user interaction (e.g. listening to a due recording adds to
  "Recording Reviews").
* A background worker dispatches a stylized HTML weekly email via SMTP; queued + drained on reconnect.

### tickets
- **T6.1 — Metrics schema + ingestion.** `metrics_events` table; increment Lesson Duration, Journaling
  Output, Flashcards reviewed from existing flows. "Completed Queue items" is **derived directly from
  `review_events`** (count of milestone completions in the window) — do not duplicate it into a second
  counter. *ACs:* FR-1.5.1. *Deps:* T0.2, T2.2.
- **T6.2 — Metrics aggregation (pure Dart).** Roll up events into daily/weekly/monthly series. *ACs:*
  FR-1.5.1. *Deps:* T6.1. (Pure-Dart, unit-tested.) ✅ PR #43
- **T6.3 — Analytics dashboard.** `fl_chart` daily/weekly/monthly views; premium styling; empty states.
  *ACs:* FR-1.5.2, M6 AC 1, NFR-2.4.1. *Deps:* T6.2. ✅ PR #44
- **T6.4 — HTML report renderer.** Render the weekly aggregate into a stylized HTML template. *ACs:*
  FR-1.5.3 (render). *Deps:* T6.2. ✅ PR #45
- **T6.5 — SMTP email service (abstract seam).** `EmailService` interface; SMTP impl via `mailer`; creds
  in encrypted local KV (user-supplied Gmail app-password); enqueue + drain on reconnect. *ACs:*
  FR-1.5.3, NFR-2.1.3, NFR-2.6.1. *Deps:* T0.3, T6.4. ✅ PR #46
- **T6.6 — Weekly report scheduler.** `workmanager` periodic worker; dispatch the rendered HTML email
  weekly; retry/backoff; in-app "last send / next send" indicator. *ACs:* FR-1.5.3, M6 AC 3. *Deps:*
  T6.5. ✅ PR #47

## COMPLETE Milestone 7: UX & Queue Polish (post-M4 feedback)

**Objective:** Make the app feel alive on day one and remove friction in the
recording detail flow. These are real-use findings, not new scope — they sharpen
existing M1–M3 surfaces.

### User stories
* As a new learner, I want my Today and Tomorrow queues to each show at least 3
  recordings right after my first sync, so the app is immediately useful (not an
  empty list on day 1).
* As a learner viewing a recording, I want the detail screen focused on content
  (vocab + timeline), not file metadata, and I want the vocab list above the
  review timeline.
* As a learner, I want to tap an attached image and pinch-to-zoom it full-screen.
* As a learner, tapping "mark reviewed" must NOT scroll-jump me to the top of the
  screen.

### Acceptance criteria
* After first index, the Tomorrow preview shows **≥3** recordings (topped up
  from the soonest-next-due if the strict-GPA due-tomorrow set is smaller). The
  canonical GPA intervals are NOT altered — top-ups are presented as
  reviewable-early, not rescheduled.
  *Superseded by M10 AC4:* the Today queue **no longer** has a ≥3 floor — Today
  shows only the strict due-set (active milestone due today or 1-day-stale).
  M7 AC1's "Today ≥3" wording is withdrawn; the Tomorrow ≥3 floor stands.
* The recording detail screen no longer shows duration / size / format chips;
  the GPA milestone (D+N) list renders **below** the vocab log section.
* Tapping an attached image opens a full-screen viewer with pinch-zoom
  (`InteractiveViewer`) and a dismiss affordance.
* Toggling a milestone's reviewed state preserves the current scroll position
  (no jump to top).

### Tickets
- **T7.1 — Queue warm-up top-up.** When the strict due-today queue has fewer
  than 3, top it up to 3 from the soonest-next-due recordings (reviewable early,
  badged "up next"); apply the same ≥3 floor to the Tomorrow preview. Pure-Dart
  selector over the existing GPA derivation — no schema change, no rescheduling.
  *ACs:* M7 AC 1. *Deps:* T2.4 (today queue + stale rule).
  *Superseded by T10.1:* the Today top-up half is removed (Today strict-only).
  T7.1's Tomorrow top-up logic remains in force.
- **T7.2 — Recording detail layout trim + reorder.** Remove the duration / size
  / format chips from the detail screen; move the D+N milestone list to render
  below the vocab log section. *ACs:* M7 AC 2. *Deps:* T1.6, T3.4.
- **T7.3 — Image full-screen zoom viewer.** Tap an attached word-log image →
  full-screen `InteractiveViewer` (pinch-zoom, pan, swipe/tap to dismiss).
  *ACs:* M7 AC 3. *Deps:* T3.3 (image-log attach).
- **T7.4 — No scroll-jump on mark-reviewed.** Preserve the scroll offset across
  a reviewed-state toggle on the recording detail / timeline (root-cause the
  rebuild that resets the offset; keep a stable `ScrollController` / keys).
  *ACs:* M7 AC 4. *Deps:* T2.6.

---

## Milestone 8: Playback-flow & safe-area fixes (post-M7 feedback) — T8.1/T8.2/T8.3/T8.4 done (image-render *bug* still open under T9.2)

**Objective:** Four real-use findings from the playback + library flow. The first
three tighten how the queue, the player, and attached images behave; the fourth
fixes the app drawing under Android's system navigation bar. No new scope — these
sharpen M1–M3 surfaces (and one is a platform/edge-to-edge bug).

### User stories
* As a learner in the review queue, I want tapping a recording to open its full
  detail page (not just start inline playback), and to land back on the queue
  when I leave.
* As a listener, when a recording finishes I want the next one to start
  automatically — the next item in the queue if I launched from the queue, or
  the preceding recording in my library list otherwise.
* As a learner, I want an attached notebook photo to render as the image, both
  as the thumbnail and in the full-screen viewer (today it shows a placeholder).
* As a user, I want the app's UI to stop at Android's system navigation buttons,
  not slide underneath them.

### Acceptance criteria
* Tapping a queue row pushes the recording detail route (which auto-plays); the
  inline long-press shortcut is removed. Popping the detail returns to the queue
  at the same scroll position.
* On natural playback completion the detail advances to the next recording:
  next-in-queue (today then tomorrow order) when launched from the queue, or the
  preceding library row otherwise. No advance at the end of the available list;
  manual replay still works.
* An attached word-log image renders its bytes (thumbnail + full-screen); when
  the file is missing/corrupt the tile reports a clear, diagnosable state.
* With `targetSdk` 35 forcing edge-to-edge, the home shell's bottom nav and the
  detail screen's content sit above the system navigation bar (no content drawn
  under the 3 buttons).

### Tickets
- **T8.1 — Queue tap opens detail.** `_WarmedTile.onTap` pushes the detail route
  (carrying queue peer-context — see T8.2); drop the long-press navigation and
  the inline play-on-tap (the detail auto-plays on open). *ACs:* M8 AC 1.
  *Deps:* T1.6.
- **T8.2 — Auto-advance on completion.** Carry an ordered peer-id list + a
  launch source (`queue` / `library`) to the detail route via go_router `extra`.
  The detail screen watches the player snapshot; on the transition to
  `isCompleted` it advances: queue → next id in queue order; library → preceding
  id in the list. Advance re-places the route with the same peer-context so the
  chain continues; manual replay and end-of-list are handled. *ACs:* M8 AC 2.
  *Deps:* T1.5, T1.6.
- **T8.3 — Word-log image render.** The stored app-relative path already resolves
  under the same base the DB + AI cache use (verified — those work), so the
  thumbnail/full-screen `Image.file` failure is diagnosed rather than guessed at:
  log the resolved path + existence under the `wordlog` tag, and replace the bare
  broken-image icon with a clear "couldn't load" tile. Re-attach + share the log
  to root-cause the on-device copy/decode failure. *ACs:* M8 AC 3. *Deps:* T3.3.
  ✅ PR #31 (diagnostics + tile; on-device byte fix deferred to T9.2).
- **T8.4 — Android safe-area.** Enable `SystemUiMode.edgeToEdge` in `main` so the
  system-bar insets are exposed, then ensure the home shell's `NavigationBar` and
  the detail screen's body sit above the bottom inset (`SafeArea`). *ACs:* M8 AC 4.
  *Deps:* T2.5 (home shell), T1.6.

---

## Milestone 9: Real-use feedback batch 2 + AnkiDroid 2.24 rework (post-M8)

**Objective:** Two re-opened bugs and four polish items from the latest real-use
pass. The headline: the Anki export "permission" fix (PR #41) was aimed at the
*old* AnkiDroid API model — on AnkiDroid 2.24 the v1.1.0 `READ_WRITE_DATABASE`
custom permission no longer grants content-provider access, and the user-facing
flow has changed (global "Enable AnkiDroid API" toggle + a third-party-apps
GitHub allowlist; no per-app grant screen). The image-attach render bug from
T8.3 also remains open.

### User stories
* As a learner, I want "Send to Anki" to actually work against a current
  AnkiDroid install (2.24+), not a 2020-era API model.
* As a learner, I want attached notebook photos to render (thumbnail + full
  screen), not show "couldn't load".
* As a learner, I want the library + review lists to show which recording is
  currently playing.
* As a learner, I want tasks to open in a detail view on tap and enter edit
  mode on a further tap (Todoist-style), not jump straight to editing.

### Acceptance criteria
* "Send to Anki" succeeds on AnkiDroid 2.24 without a manual permission dance,
  OR fails with a hint that matches the modern AnkiDroid UI (no stale
  "Settings → Advanced → API → allow Rivendell" copy).
* An attached image renders its bytes (thumbnail + full-screen) on first
  attach; a missing/corrupt file reports a clear, diagnosable state.
* The currently-playing recording is visually indicated in the library list
  and the review queue.
* A task row opens a detail view on tap; a further tap enters edit mode.

### Tickets
- **NOT DONE T9.1 — AnkiDroid API v2 migration.** Swap the bundled `api-1.1.0.aar` for
  the modern AnkiDroid API release that exposes `shouldRequestPermission()` /
  `requestPermission()`; drive the runtime grant intent from the export flow
  before the first content-provider call. Remove the now-stale v1.1.0
  `READ_WRITE_DATABASE` guidance. *ACs:* M9 AC 1. *Deps:* T4.1.
- **T9.2 — Word-log image render (root cause).** T8.3 added diagnostics but the
  copy still produced an unrenderable file. Root cause: the SAF `copyTo` wrote
  source bytes verbatim, so a corrupt/partial stream or a Samsung mime-mismatch
  (e.g. HEIC bytes served under `image/jpeg`) landed bytes Flutter's
  `Image.file` could not decode. Fix: re-encode the picked image through
  `BitmapFactory` (decode bounds → sample to a 2048px max edge → re-encode as
  JPEG/PNG to match the destination extension, recycle the bitmap) and throw a
  typed `IOException` on a corrupt/undecodable source so the caller surfaces
  the failure rather than writing a broken file. JPG/PNG only (FR-1.3.1).

## COMPLETE Milestone 10: Real-use feedback batch 3 — capture naming, rename/delete, queue strictness (post-M9) — T10.1/T10.2/T10.3/T10.4/T10.5 done (shipped together via PR #42)

**Objective:** Four real-use findings. Two add file management the indexer-only
model lacked (in-app rename + delete, both touching the physical file in the
Samsung folder); one fixes capture so a recording is named when taken; two
tighten the queue (Today strict-only per user feedback, Tomorrow visually
de-emphasized). M10 AC4 amends M7 AC1.

### User stories
* As a learner, I want to name a recording while I'm taking it so the saved
  file reflects content, not a timestamp.
* As a learner, I want to rename a recording in-app and have the file on disk
  follow.
* As a learner, I want to delete a recording in-app — file + all its data —
  without leaving stale rows.
* As a learner, I want Today's queue to show only what's genuinely due (no early
  filler), so I trust the queue.
* As a learner, I want Tomorrow's preview clearly de-emphasized so Today stands
  out.

### Acceptance criteria
* The record sheet shows a name field while recording (pre-filled with the
  auto-generated default). The entered name becomes the saved filename **and**
  the display name; blank falls back to the default.
* Rename from a recording's detail screen renames both the DB row (display name
  + `filePath` upsert key) and the physical file in the Samsung folder
  atomically; a re-scan does not resurrect the old name.
* Delete from a recording's detail screen removes the physical file and
  cascades the DB row + its `review_events`, `word_logs`, image logs, and
  coach-bank links; a confirm dialog precedes deletion. Re-scan does not
  resurrect the row.
* **(Amends M7 AC1)** Today's queue shows only the strict due-set (active
  milestone due today or 1-day-stale); the ≥3 Today floor is revoked.
* Tomorrow's preview is **also strict-only**: it shows only active milestones
  due tomorrow exactly (overdue == -1). The ≥3 floor and "up next" filler are
  revoked for both windows. A recording appears in either queue only when on
  or past its next review date.
* Tomorrow's preview rows render de-emphasized (muted/grey, lower visual
  weight) relative to Today.

### tickets
- **T10.1 — Queue strict-only (Today + Tomorrow).** Drop ALL top-up / filler
  from `warmUpQueue` (queue_warmup.dart). Today = active milestone due today or
  1-day-stale. Tomorrow = active milestone due tomorrow exactly (overdue == -1).
  Remove `WarmPlacement` / `kWarmFloor` / `floor` param (single-value enum is
  dead weight). Amend M7 AC1 wording + queue-warmup unit tests. *ACs:*
  M10 AC4 + AC5(strict). *Deps:* T7.1.
  ✅ PR #42.
- **T10.2 — Tomorrow preview de-emphasis.** Render tomorrow-section rows in
  `today_queue_screen.dart` with muted color + reduced weight vs Today (e.g.
  `onSurfaceVariant` at reduced opacity, smaller leading badge). Today retains
  full emphasis. Pure presentation. *ACs:* M10 AC5. *Deps:* T2.5, T10.1.
  ✅ PR #42.
- **T10.3 — Name-on-capture.** Add an editable name field to the record sheet
  (visible while recording), pre-filled with `buildRecordingFileName` default.
  On stop, `RecorderController.stop` uses the entered name as both the writer's
  `displayName` and the indexed display name; blank or unchanged → default. The
  temp-path → folder-copy step preserves the file extension. *ACs:* M10 AC1.
  *Deps:* T2.7.
  ✅ PR #42.
- **T10.4 — Rename recording (DB + file).** ✅ PR #42. Detail-screen AppBar menu
  → Rename dialog. `RecordingManagementService.renameRecording` sanitizes the
  base name (shared `sanitizeRecordingBaseName`), SAF-renames the doc via
  `rivendell/record` → `renameDocument`, and writes the DB row's `name` +
  `filePath` atomically (`RecordingRepository.updateNameAndPath`). The
  authoritative new URI comes from SAF (the stem can shift on collision), so
  the next rescan keys on the new path — no re-add. Falls back to a
  timestamped base if the input sanitizes to empty; throws on SAF failure
  without mutating the DB. *ACs:* M10 AC2. *Deps:* T1.3, T10.3.
- **T10.5 — Delete recording (DB + file, cascade).** ✅ PR #42. Detail-screen
  AppBar menu → hard-confirm dialog ("Delete <name>? This removes the audio
  file and all its vocab and review data.", no undo). `RecordingManagementService.
  deleteRecording` best-effort wipes `wordlog/<id>/` (dart:io, app-private),
  best-effort SAF-deletes the audio (`deleteDocument`), then a single
  `recordings.deleteById` whose FK cascade drops `review_events`, `word_logs`,
  `coach_note_recordings`, `coach_note_word_logs`. File-op failures are logged
  but never block the DB delete. On success the detail screen pops; on failure
  a snackbar surfaces. *ACs:* M10 AC3. *Deps:* T1.2, T3.1.

These are deferred, not blocking M0–M1. Surface them when their milestone approaches:

1. **Fal.ai model + prompt** — which Fal.ai endpoint/model for concept images, and the prompt template
   (language-neutral pictographic vs. culturally-specific)? Decide at T4.3.
2. **SMTP provider** — a transactional SMTP (e.g. free-tier Resend/Mailgun/Brevo) vs. user-supplied Gmail
  app-password. Affects key handling at T6.5.
3. **AnkiDroid minimum version** — which AnkiDroid version's intent API do we target? Decide at T4.1.
4. **Weekly report cadence anchor** — "weekly" anchored to calendar week (Mon 00:00) vs. install
  anniversary. Decide at T6.6.
5. **Uzbek text normalization** — Latin vs. Cyrillic Uzbek; does the parser normalize both? Decide at T3.2.

## Milestone 11: XP & Streak Motivation Layer

**Objective:** Layer a lightweight, non-punitive progress signal on top of the existing review pipeline —
a single XP total/level and a daily streak counter. XP **itself** is a derived view (sum of an append-only
`xp_events` ledger, level banded at 500 XP — never a hand-edited counter, matching decision #9). The
**only** manual input is an optional reading/movie activity log; everything else (reviews, word-log
attaches, Anki exports, tasks) posts XP automatically as a side effect. Streaks have **1 freeze per
week** (for a day off). Nothing is ever gated on XP or streak.

### User stories
* As a learner, I want a single XP total and level that grows automatically from actions I'm already
  taking in the app, so progress feels earned without a separate logging chore.
* As a learner, I want to optionally log a reading or movie-watching session for extra XP.
* As a learner, I want a visible daily streak that survives one missed day per week.

### Acceptance criteria
* Dashboard shows a current XP total + level (derived, fixed band — **500 XP/level**), computed from an
  append-only `xp_events` ledger, never a hand-edited counter.
* XP posts automatically as a side effect of five actions: a review-event completion, a word-log attach,
  a successful Anki export, a task marked complete, **and** a logged reading/movie activity. Canonical
  point values: review **+10**, word-log attach **+5**, Anki export **+2 per card** (matches the
  `flashcards_reviewed` metric), task complete **+8**, reading/movie log **+15**.
* Streak count derives from consecutive calendar days with **≥1 review-event**; a missed day consumes
  one available streak-freeze token (auto-granted weekly, **capped at 1 banked**) before the streak
  resets to 0. Reading/movie logs feed XP only — not the streak.
* XP + level + streak are visible on **all main screens** via a shared persistent indicator, and the
  indicator can be hidden from Settings (default: shown).
* No feature is ever gated, disabled, or hidden as a consequence of a broken streak or a zero XP
  balance — streak/XP are purely informational.

### Tickets
- **T11.1 — XP ledger schema + engine (pure Dart).** Add an `xp_events` table
  (`features/progress/data/xp_events_table.dart`, mirroring `metrics_events_table.dart`): columns
  `id` (autoInc), `source` (text — `review`/`wordlog`/`anki`/`task`/`reading`/`movie`), `points`
  (int, non-negative), `recordingId` (int, nullable, FK→recordings), `taskId` (int, nullable,
  FK→tasks), `at` (DateTime, default now). Register in `app_database.dart` (`tables:`, bump
  `schemaVersion` to 10, add `if (from < 10) await m.createTable(xpEvents);`).
  Domain (`features/progress/domain/xp_level.dart`): `int levelFromTotalXp(int total) => total ~/ 500;`
  + `int xpIntoLevel(int total) => total % 500;` + an `XpSource` enum with stable `columnValue`
  strings (mirror `MetricKind`). Pure-Dart unit tests: level banding at 0/499/500/999/1000, negative
  total clamps to 0. *ACs:* M11 AC 1. *Deps:* T0.2.
- **T11.2 — XP awarding hooks.** Wire `xp_events` inserts into the five completion points — no new UI
  for four of them, XP is a side effect:
  - **review** (+10): `ReviewEventRepository.recordReview` + `markReviewed` (`features/gpa/data/review_event_repository.dart`) — insert the xp row in the same transaction.
  - **wordlog** (+5): `WordLogRepository.setTextLog` (non-empty body) + `ImageLogService.attach` success (`features/wordlog/`).
  - **anki** (+2 × cards exported): `AnkiExportService` success path (`features/anki/application/anki_export_service.dart`) — points = 2 × notes added.
  - **task** (+8): task-completion mutation in `TaskRepository`/`task_commands.dart` (`features/tasks/`).
  - **reading/movie** (+15): the T11.4 log insert.
  All inserts go through a small `XpRepository.record(source, points, {recordingId, taskId})` over the
  `xp_events` table (mirror `MetricsRepository.record`). Idempotency: review/anki hooks fire once per
  completion (the existing transaction guards double-fires); wordlog setTextLog is replace-on-edit so
  award only when the body changes from empty→non-empty (track via the prior row). Unit tests assert
  each hook writes exactly one row with the expected source+points. *ACs:* M11 AC 2. *Deps:* T11.1,
  T2.2, T3.2, T4.4, T5.2.
- **T11.3 — Streak + freeze engine (pure Dart).** Domain
  `features/progress/domain/streak_engine.dart`. `StreakResult computeStreak({required
  List<DateTime> reviewDays, required DateTime asOf, required int freezesBanked})` — consecutive
  calendar days with ≥1 review-event ending on `asOf` (or `asOf-1` if asOf itself has none, so "today
  not yet reviewed" doesn't read as a break); a 1-day gap consumes one banked freeze (gap collapses,
  streak continues); a longer gap or a gap with no freeze → streak 0. Source = `review_events`
  `completedAt` day-set (reuse `ReviewEventRepository.eventTimestamps`). Freeze state is the one
  mutable counter (not derivable from reviews): store `streak_freezes_banked` (int) +
  `streak_freezes_last_grant_week` (ISO week id) in `key_values` via `KvRepository`; on compute, if the
  current ISO week > last-grant week and banked < 1, set banked = 1 and stamp last-grant. Pure-Dart
  engine tests: 3-day run, gap-with-freeze continues, gap-no-freeze resets, freeze auto-grant fires
  once per ISO week, cap-1 banking. **No UI gating on reset.** *ACs:* M11 AC 3. *Deps:* T2.3, T11.1.
- **T11.4 — Reading/movie activity log.** New manual XP source. Schema: `activity_logs` table
  (`features/progress/data/activity_logs_table.dart`): `id`, `kind` (`reading`/`movie`), `title`
  (text), `durationMinutes` (int, nullable), `at` (DateTime). Register in `app_database.dart`
  (schemaVersion bump to 11 — fold with T11.1's bump if shipped together). Repository +
  Riverpod providers under `features/progress/`. Entry UI: an "Log activity" action (FAB on the
  progress dashboard or a menu item) opens a dialog (`AlertDialog`) with kind selector, title field,
  optional duration field; on save, insert the `activity_logs` row **and** fire the T11.2
  reading/movie XP hook (+15). List view of past logs on the dashboard (optional delete). Pure-Dart
  repo tests + a widget test for the dialog. *ACs:* M11 AC 2 (5th source). *Deps:* T11.1, T11.2.
- **T11.5 — XP & streak dashboard card + global indicator + settings toggle.**
  - **Dashboard card** on `today_queue_screen.dart` (above the queue list): level + `xpIntoLevel/500`
    progress bar + streak count + a freeze-available badge (frost icon when `banked > 0`).
  - **Global indicator** visible on all main screens: a compact level/streak chip in the `HomeShell`
    AppBar (read from a `progressSnapshotProvider` that fans out `xp_events` sum + streak result).
  - **Settings toggle**: add `showProgressIndicator` (bool, default true) to `AppSettings`
    (`features/settings/domain/app_settings.dart`) + `AppSettingsNotifier`
    (`features/settings/application/settings_providers.dart`) persisted via `KvRepository`
    (key `settings.show_progress`) — mirrors the existing auto-advance/theme pattern. When off, the
    global indicator hides; the dashboard card stays.
  Widget tests: card renders level/XP/streak from a faked ledger; toggle hides the chip. *ACs:*
  M11 AC 1, AC 3, AC 4. *Deps:* T2.5, T11.1, T11.3.

## Milestone 14: Real-use feedback batch 4 — queue backlog, capture indexing, crash + render bugs (post-M11)

**Objective:** Five findings from the latest real-use pass. One widens Today's queue back to a
forgiving 2-week backlog (the **third** Today revision: M7 ≥3 floor → M10 strict-only → M14
2-week-backlog, cap 4); one crashes the settings screen on open; one shows an auto-advanced
recording as zero-length; one re-opens the word-log image attach bug after **three** failed
attempts; one gets in-app captures into Samsung Voice Recorder's global "All recordings" tab via
MediaStore. No new scope — all sharpen existing surfaces.

### User stories
* As a learner, I want Today to surface anything I've let slip in the last two weeks (up to four),
  not just what's due today, so a missed day doesn't drop recordings out of sight.
* As a user, I want the Settings screen to open without crashing.
* As a listener, when a recording auto-advances I want the next one to show its real length, not
  "0:00".
* As a learner, I want to attach a notebook photo and actually see it attach (this has failed three
  times).
* As a learner recording in-app, I want the capture to also appear in Samsung Voice Recorder's "All
  recordings" tab, not just inside Rivendell.

### Acceptance criteria
* **(Amends M10 AC4)** Today's queue shows recordings whose active milestone became due in the last
  2 weeks (overdue 0..13 days), most-overdue first, **capped at 4**. The 1-day-stale special case +
  badge is subsumed by the backlog window (every Today row is simply "due", ordered by overdue days).
  M10's strict-only Today wording is withdrawn. **Tomorrow stays strict-only** (M10 AC5 unchanged —
  overdue == −1 exactly); the cap + 2-week window apply to Today only.
* The Settings screen opens without throwing; the SMTP-credentials block renders populated on second
  open and never throws `LateInitializationError`.
* After an auto-advance, the detail screen shows the new recording's real duration immediately (no
  transient "0:00 / 0:00"); the slider is usable as soon as the row loads.
* Attaching a JPG/PNG notebook photo produces a renderable thumbnail + full-screen image on the
  **first** attach, on device. A genuine decode failure (corrupt source, unsupported bytes) surfaces
  a precise, diagnosable error — not a silent no-op or a bare "couldn't load".
* A recording captured in-app is queryable by Samsung Voice Recorder's "All recordings" tab on
  Android 12+ (MediaStore row with `IS_RECORDING=1`, album/artist "Voice Recorder"). Captures on
  older One UI degrade gracefully (best-effort insert, never blocks the save).

### Tickets
- **COMPLETE (#51) T14.1 — Today queue: 2-week backlog, cap 4.** In `features/gpa/domain/queue_warmup.dart`, change
  the Today membership test from `overdue >= 0 && overdue < 2` to `overdue >= 0 && overdue <= 13`,
  then take the **top 4** by most-overdue (the existing `_compareByDueThenId` sorts overdue-ascending;
  slice to 4 after sort). Drop the `isStale` distinction for Today rows (every Today row is now simply
  due; the stale badge is removed from the Today path — the Tomorrow path is untouched). Update
  `features/gpa/data/review_event_repository.dart` `warmedQueue` doc + the `_WarmedTile` stale branch
  in `features/gpa/presentation/today_queue_screen.dart`. Amend M10 AC4 wording + the queue-warmup
  unit tests (new cases: overdue 0/1/5/13 in; 14+ out; exactly-4 cap; ordering most-overdue-first;
  Tomorrow still overdue==−1 only). Pure-Dart, no schema change. *ACs:* M14 AC 1. *Deps:* T10.1
  (Today strict-only — superseded).
- **COMPLETE (#52) T14.2 — Settings screen `LateInitializationError` fix.** Root cause:
  `features/report/presentation/weekly_report_settings_section.dart:29-31` declares
  `late final TextEditingController _username/_password/_recipient` but never constructs them —
  `_hydrate` only writes `.text`, and `build` reads `_username` (line ~150) before any assignment,
  throwing `LateInitializationError: field '_username' has not been initialised`. Fix: construct the
  three controllers in `initState` (empty text; `_hydrate` then sets username/recipient text after
  the KV read; password stays blank). Keep `dispose` disposing all three. Regression: a widget test
  that mounts `SettingsScreen` (faked `settingsRepositoryProvider`) asserts it builds without
  throwing and a second open re-hydrates saved values. *ACs:* M14 AC 2. *Deps:* T6.6.
- **COMPLETE (#53) T14.3 — Auto-advance shows real duration (seed only; persist-back deferred).** Root cause:
  `features/audio/presentation/recording_detail_screen.dart` `_DetailContent` computes
  `totalMs = snap.duration.inMilliseconds` (0 until the engine emits `MediaItem.duration`), so right
  after `context.replace('/recordings/$nextId')` the new row shows "0:00" + an indeterminate bar. The
  DB already carries `recordings.durationMs` (nullable, filled lazily — see `recordings_table.dart`).
  Fix: seed the controller's duration floor from the recording row — pass `durationMs` into
  `AudioPlayerController.loadAndPlay` (`features/audio/playback/application/audio_player_controller.dart`)
  so `_duration` initializes from it before the media-item stream fires. Persist the engine-resolved
  duration back to `recordings.durationMs` when it lands (in `_onMediaItem`) so later opens are
  instant. Tests: controller unit test that `loadAndPlay` with a non-null `durationMs` emits a
  snapshot with that duration before any transport event. *ACs:* M14 AC 3. *Deps:* T8.2, T1.5.
  **Shipped (#53):** seed-only — `loadAndPlay` seeds `_duration` from `recording.durationMs`,
  emits via `scheduleMicrotask` (the synchronous emit tripped Riverpod's build-phase guard since
  `loadAndPlay` runs in the detail screen's build branch). **Persist-back deferred to T15.x:**
  writing from the controller forces creation of `appDatabaseProvider`/`recordingRepositoryProvider`
  during a build frame in widget tests that don't override the DB, entangling the same guard; needs
  a cleaner injection seam (capture the repo at boot, not mid-build). The zero-length bug is fixed.
- **COMPLETE (#54, pending device confirm) T14.4 — Word-log image attach root-cause (open-once fix).** Failed three times (T8.3 diagnostics,
  T9.2 BitmapFactory re-encode). Symptom is "doesn't attach" — the `wordLogAttachFailed` snackbar
  from `word_log_section.dart _attachImage`, which fires on `isSupportedImageExt` rejection **or**
  `service.attach` throwing **or** the picker returning null (silent). Treat as unknown root cause
  and prove the fix on device — do **not** guess again. Audit (read, in order):
  `features/wordlog/platform/saf_image_log_picker_service.dart` + the Kotlin `pickImage` handler on
  `rivendell/wordlog` in `MainActivity.kt` (does the PhotoPicker launch + return a usable, persistent
  URI?); `features/wordlog/domain/supported_image_format.dart` (does it reject real-world ext like
  `.jpeg`/HEIC?); `image_log_service.attach` + `saf_image_writer_service` Kotlin (does the re-encode
  throw on a revoked / single-use PhotoPicker URI?); the `rivendell/wordlog` channel contract test.
  Instrument every hop under the `wordlog` tag (picker result, ext, channel return, bytes written,
  DB row id) so a failure leaves a precise trail. Reproduce on device, fix the actual root cause, and
  prove a **fresh** attach renders both the thumbnail + the full-screen `_FullScreenImage`. If the
  root cause is a single-use PhotoPicker URI revoked before copy, the fix is to take a persistent
  copy (or re-encoded bytes) before returning from the picker. *ACs:* M14 AC 4. *Deps:* T3.3, T9.2.
  **Shipped (#54):** audit pointed to `copyImage` reopening the picker URI twice (bounds, then decode);
  on Samsung the PickVisualMedia grant isn't reliably reusable, so the 2nd `openInputStream()` threw
  SecurityException → "could not decode image bytes" → `wordLogAttachFailed`. Fix: buffer the URI bytes
  once, decode from the buffer (2 opens → 1). Native-only; **device confirm still required** (fresh
  attach → thumbnail + `_FullScreenImage`). Secondary finding left as-is: `mimeToExt` rejects HEIC at
  the picker (FR-1.3.1 is JPG/PNG), so T9.2's HEIC re-encoder is unreachable for HEIC sources.
- **T14.5 — Capture → Samsung "All recordings" via MediaStore.** In-app captures already save to the
  Samsung folder via SAF (`saf_recording_writer_service.copyToFolder` on `rivendell/record`), but
  Samsung Voice Recorder's "All recordings" tab queries MediaStore with voice-recording flags, so a
  SAF-only file is invisible there. Add a Kotlin method `publishToMediaStore` on the `rivendell/record`
  channel: insert a `MediaStore.Audio.Media.EXTERNAL_CONTENT_URI` row with `DISPLAY_NAME`,
  `MIME_TYPE=audio/mp4`, `RELATIVE_PATH=Recordings/Voice Recorder`, `ALBUM="Voice Recorder"`,
  `ARTIST="Voice Recorder"`, and on API 31+ `IS_RECORDING=1`, `IS_MUSIC=0`; open the returned
  `OutputStream` and stream the just-written file's bytes in. Dart side: after `copyToFolder`
  succeeds in `recorder_controller.dart`, call `publishToMediaStore` with the new URI + display name.
  Best-effort — on failure log under the `RECORD` tag and continue (the recording is already saved;
  MediaStore visibility is additive). Gate the `IS_RECORDING` flag on `Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= S`.
  *ACs:* M14 AC 5. *Deps:* T2.7, T10.3.

  **COMPLETE (#55, dev `cdf9dc7`).** Kotlin `publishToMediaStore` on `rivendell/record` inserts
  `MediaStore.Audio.Media.EXTERNAL_CONTENT_URI` (DISPLAY_NAME / `audio/mp4` /
  `Recordings/Voice Recorder` / `IS_RECORDING=1`,`IS_MUSIC=0` on API 31+) + streams the doc-URI bytes
  via `openOutputStream`. Dart: abstract port method, Saf impl (channel contract, throws
  `FileSystemException`), `recorder_controller.stop` captures the `copyToFolder` doc URI and calls
  publish best-effort (`on Object catch` → warn-log → continue). Tests: happy path asserts
  `publishCalls==1` + args; new "publish failure still reaches idle" pins non-fatal. Gate green incl.
  Android debug APK. **Note:** PR #55 squash-landed on `main` by mistake (`gh pr create` defaulted
  base `main`); dev got the change via FF from the feature branch `cdf9dc7` (parent `43ca556` = dev).
  `main`/`dev` now diverged — reconcile on next dev→main sync. **Device confirm still wanted:**
  record in-app, verify capture appears under Samsung Voice Recorder "All recordings".

## Milestone 15: Architecture health pass — review, refactor, gate efficiency (post-M11)

**Objective:** Two non-feature asks. (1) A critical architecture review across the whole app, then
a spawned refactor milestone for long-term maintainability. (2) Make the Standard Gate cheaper and
guarantee it's wired as a hook. No user-visible behavior change.

### User stories
* As the maintainer, I want an honest audit of how the app is structured after this much accretion,
  so the next milestones don't compound the rough edges.
* As the maintainer, I want the gate to run fast enough that I actually run it, and certainty that
  it fires on every push.

### Acceptance criteria
* A written architecture review lives at `docs/architecture-review.md`: per-feature boundary check
  (presentation/application/data/domain seams), repository/service/provider consistency, Drift
  migration + derive-don't-store invariant adherence, test-coverage gaps against the 80% floor, dead
  code, duplication, error-handling consistency, i18n completeness, and NFR-perf risks. Each finding
  is severity-tagged.
* The review **emits its own follow-up tickets** (T15.3…T15.n) appended to this milestone, ordered
  by severity — the review is not the deliverable, the refactors are. Do not start the refactors
  until the review lands and the user picks the subset to ship.
* The Standard Gate (`scripts/gate.sh`) runs materially faster on a no-op change (skips the Android
  debug build when no native/Kotlin/manifest/resource file changed; reuses the build_runner cache).
  The pre-push hook remains the canonical gate; `scripts/install-hooks.sh` is documented in the
  bootstrap step and re-runnable.

### tickets
- **T15.1 — Whole-app architecture review (read-only).** Produce `docs/architecture-review.md`.
  Cover, per feature dir under `lib/features/`: (a) layer purity (domain has no Flutter/Drift deps;
  data has no presentation deps; presentation doesn't touch the DB directly); (b) repository +
  service + provider naming/seam consistency vs the M0 pattern; (c) Drift migration hygiene
  (schemaVersion bumps, idempotent `onUpgrade` branches, FK pragmas); (d) the two invariants —
  append-only event logs (`review_events`, `metrics_events`, `xp_events`) and derive-don't-store
  (`RecordingReviewStatus`, queue, XP level, streak count) — audited for accidental mutable
  counters (freeze bank is the one allowed exception); (e) test-coverage holes against
  `scripts/check_coverage.dart`; (f) dead code + duplication across the M7–M10 queue churn (e.g.
  `WarmPlacement`-style leftovers, the two parallel queue shapes in `review_event_repository`:
  `todayQueue` vs `warmedQueue`); (g) error-handling consistency (swallowed `on Object` catches,
  missing user surfacing); (h) i18n — any hardcoded user-facing strings; (i) NFR-perf risks (N+1
  queries, main-isolate file work, unbounded list builders). Output = the doc + a severity-ordered
  refactor list that becomes T15.3+. *ACs:* M15 AC 1. *Deps:* none (read-only).

  **COMPLETE (#56).** `docs/architecture-review.md` written — 9 dimensions, severity-tagged,
  every `high`/`med` claim spot-checked against source. Headline: app is healthy; migrations
  idempotent (schemaVersion 9); both invariants hold (append-only logs, derive-don't-store); no
  N+1; indexer offloads correctly; no orphan codegen; all providers have live consumers. Actionable
  debt concentrated in: dead M7 queue shape (`todayQueue` family), one silent FR-1.2.3 swallow
  (`review_providers:56-59`), `coach` off the M0 pattern, two list-perf hotspots (`coach_note_dialog`
  unbounded `ListView`; `_WarmedTile` no-`.select` rebuild storm), one un-localized onboarding screen,
  SAF adapter stack-trace drops (incl. T14.5 publish path). Coverage 90.8% (floor 80%); holes at
  `app_database` 32% (no migration-step tests), `recording_indexer` 62%, provider-glue files.
  Emitted **T15.3–T15.16** (14 tickets, severity-ordered, appended below) — user picks subset before
  work begins. Plan-spec staleness logged for T15.15: `WarmPlacement`, gamification, "three event
  repos", `todayQueue` "parallel" all do not match the code.
- **T15.2 — Gate efficiency + hook assurance.** (a) Teach `scripts/gate.sh` to skip the Android
  debug build (step 6) when `git diff` against the merge-base shows no change under
  `app/android/**`, `**/*.kt`, `**/*.gradle*`, or `AndroidManifest.xml` — print a clear
  `gate: android skipped (no native change)` line. (b) Ensure `dart run build_runner` reuses cached
  outputs (don't blow away `.dart_tool/build` between runs). (c) Confirm the pre-push hook
  (`scripts/git-hooks/pre-push`) still `exec`s `gate.sh` verbatim and that
  `scripts/install-hooks.sh` installs pre-push + pre-commit + commit-msg; document running it in
  `setup.md` bootstrap. (d) Add a `gate --fast` mode (`SKIP_ANDROID=1` + skip codegen when no
  `.g.dart`/`.freezed.dart` source changed) for the inner-loop cycle. No change to what "green"
  means on a real push. *ACs:* M15 AC 3. *Deps:* T0.1.

  **COMPLETE (#57).** `scripts/gate.sh` rewritten:
  (a) Android debug build skipped automatically when `git diff <upstream-merge-base>..HEAD` touches
  no native file (`app/android/**`, `*.kt`, `*.gradle*`, `AndroidManifest.xml`) — prints
  `gate: android skipped (no native change)`; `GATE_FORCE_ANDROID=1` overrides.
  (b) `build_runner` already incremental (`.dart_tool/build` reused; `--delete-conflicting-outputs`
  only clears conflicting outputs, not the cache) — documented in the gate header + `setup.md`.
  (c) `pre-push` still `exec`s `gate.sh` verbatim; `install-hooks.sh` already installs all three
  hooks (commit-msg + pre-commit + pre-push) via `core.hooksPath`; `setup.md` command reference now
  documents the skip modes + `install-hooks` re-run.
  (d) `gate.sh fast` / `--fast` / `GATE_FAST=1` = `SKIP_ANDROID=1` **and** codegen skipped when no
  `.dart` declaring a generated `part` (`*.g.dart`/`*.freezed.dart`) changed vs the merge-base —
  prints `gate: codegen skipped (--fast, no codegen source changed)`.
  Verified end-to-end on this branch: full gate → `android skipped (no native change)`, 513 tests
  pass, coverage 90.8%; `--fast` → `codegen skipped (--fast, no codegen source changed)`. Safe
  default preserved: unknown merge-base → run everything.
- **T15.3 — Delete dead M7 queue shape.** `high`. Remove `todayQueue`, the gpa `QueueItem`,
  `classifyQueueEntry`, `QueueEntryKind` (all dead in prod; `warmedQueue` is the live shape). Update
  the tests that exercise them. *Deps:* none.

  **COMPLETE (#58).** Removed `ReviewEventRepository.todayQueue`, the gpa `QueueItem` class,
  `classifyQueueEntry`, `QueueEntryKind`, + the two test groups that exercised them + a stale dartdoc
  backreference. Live `core/queue QueueItem` (offline queue) + the warmed path untouched. Pure
  deletion: 4 files, +1/−271. Gate green — 499 tests (14 dead removed), coverage 90.6%, android
  auto-skipped (no native change).
- **T15.4 — Stop silent FR-1.2.3 review-event loss.** `high`. `review_providers.dart:56-59` swallows
  the `recordReview` append on the 80%-crossing watcher: user sees "reviewed" but the row is lost, no
  signal, no retry, no `reviewGenerationProvider` bump. Surface a non-blocking "couldn't save review"
  snackbar, reset the latch so the next crossing retries, bump the generator on success.
  *Deps:* none. ✅ PR #59 — added `ReviewProgressGate.rearm()`; watcher retries 3× then ticks
  `reviewSaveFailureTickProvider` → `HomeShell` snackbar. Gate + new watcher unit tests; 503 tests,
  91.1% coverage, android auto-skipped.
- **T15.5 — Bring `coach` onto the M0 pattern.** `high`. Feature is the most off-pattern: no
  `domain/` (DTOs in `data/coach_note_repository.dart`), presentation imports `data/` directly, and
  `coach_bank_screen` mutates via `repo.create/update/delete` with no `application/` orchestrator. Add
  `coach/domain/`, add a `CoachNoteCommands` write orchestrator, remove presentation→data imports.
  *Deps:* none. ✅ PR #60 — moved `CoachNoteWithLinks` to `coach/domain/`; added `CoachNoteCommands` +
  `coachNoteCommandsProvider`; presentation writes through commands, no `data/` imports. Commands
  delegation test added; 506 tests, 91.2% coverage, android auto-skipped.
- **T15.6 — `coach_note_dialog` unbounded list.** `high`. `coach_note_dialog.dart:236`
  `ListView(shrinkWrap, children:[for o in options])` materializes the full recordings list (≤1000) +
  a `shrinkWrap` measure pass on dialog open. Convert to `ListView.builder`. *Deps:* none. ✅ PR #61
  — picker sheet now `ListView.builder`; tiles build lazily on scroll instead of all-at-once on
  sheet open. Behavior-preserving; 506 tests, 91.2% coverage, android auto-skipped.
- **T15.7 — `_WarmedTile` rebuild storm.** `high`. `today_queue_screen.dart:138`
  `ref.watch(audioPlayerControllerProvider)` takes the full snapshot; just_audio's position stream
  re-emits ~5-8 Hz, so every visible tile rebuilds that fast during playback. Tile uses only
  `recordingId` + `isPlaying` → switch to `.select`, mirroring `recordings_screen.dart:148-152`.
  *Deps:* none. ✅ PR #62 — `_WarmedTile` now `ref.watch(... .select((s) => (recordingId, isPlaying,
  isError)))`; tiles rebuild on cue / play-pause / error only, not every position tick. The tile also
  reads `isError`, so it joins the tuple. Behavior-preserving; 506 tests, 91.2%, android auto-skipped.
- **T15.8 — Localize folder onboarding.** `high`. `folder_onboarding_screen.dart` has zero
  `AppStrings` calls — 6 hardcoded user-facing strings (title, body, button, 3 snackbars). Route them
  through `AppStrings` (en + uz; the `_Bundle` `required` fields enforce parity). *Deps:* none. ✅
  PR #63 — 6 strings routed through `AppStrings` (title, body parameterized on Voice Recorder folder
  name, pick, none, non-SVR warning, save failed); en + uz bundles + getter/ctor/field plumbing.
  Strings captured before async gaps so `BuildContext` is safe across awaits. Behavior-preserving;
  506 tests, 91.2%, android auto-skipped.
- **T15.9 — Preserve stack traces across SAF adapters.** `med`. Five sites catch `PlatformException`
  and rethrow a new `FileSystemException(message)`, dropping the stack: `saf_image_writer_service`
  (`:28-31`), `saf_recording_writer_service` (`:36-38` copyToFolder + `:51-55` T14.5 publishToMediaStore),
  `saf_recording_file_service` (`:30-32` rename + `:43-45` delete). Use `Error.throwWithStackTrace`.
  *Deps:* none.
- **T15.10 — Move domain DTOs out of `data/`.** `med`. `ScannedFile` is used by the abstract
  `AudioIndexerService` seam → it must live in `audio/domain/`, not `data/recording_repository.dart`.
  Revisit gpa `QueueItem`/`WarmedItem` placement after T15.3 (the dead `QueueItem` goes; `WarmedItem`
  moves to `domain/`). *Deps:* T15.3.
- **T15.11 — Offload AI image write.** `med`. `fal_ai_image_service.dart:135` does
  `file.writeAsBytes(bytes, flush: true)` for an MB-scale download on the main isolate. Move to
  `compute()`. *Deps:* none.
- **T15.12 — Extract shared timestamp-range selector.** `med`. `review_event_repository.eventTimestamps`
  ≈ `word_log_repository.textLogTimestamps` (~85% identical). One parameterized helper over table +
  column + kind. *Deps:* none.
- **T15.13 — i18n + presentation-decode polish.** `med`. `weekly_report_settings_section 'Save failed'`
  snackbar + `recording_detail 'D+7'` milestone label → `AppStrings`; move `word_log_section`
  `Image.file` decode behind an application service. *Deps:* none.
- **T15.14 — `domain/` Flutter-SDK-free.** `low`. 7 domain files import `package:flutter/foundation.dart`
  only for `@immutable`. Switch to `package:meta/meta.dart` (or drop — `@freezed` implies immutability).
  Files: gpa (`gpa_intervals`, `review_status`, `queue_warmup`), wordlog (`vocab_pair`), anki
  (`anki_model_spec`), report (`report_schedule`), audio (`recording_state`, `playback_snapshot`).
  *Deps:* none.
- **T15.15 — Reconcile `plan.md` with reality.** `low` (doc). Prune stale refs in T15.1's spec:
  `WarmPlacement` (never existed), gamification (no XP/streak/freeze-bank code), "three event repos"
  (no xp repo), "two parallel queue shapes" (`todayQueue` is dead, not parallel). *Deps:* T15.3.
- **T15.16 — Close coverage holes.** `low` (deferred). Add a v1→v9 migration-step upgrade test
  (`app_database.dart` at 32%); `recording_indexer` parse-path tests (62%, NFR-2.2.1 surface); a
  `review_providers` append-failure test that locks T15.4. *Deps:* T15.4.

**Milestone 15 COMPLETE.** All three ACs met: (1) `docs/architecture-review.md`
shipped (#56), severity-ordered refactor list emitted as T15.3+; (2) `gate.sh`
rewritten to skip the Android debug build on no-native-change + reuse
build_runner cache (#57), pre-push hook is canonical; (3) the user-selected
subset of refactors — the 6 `high`s, T15.3–T15.8 — shipped one PR each (#58 dead
queue shape, #59 silent FR-1.2.3 review-event loss + retry, #60 coach onto M0
pattern, #61 unbounded list builder, #62 `_WarmedTile` `.select` rebuild fix,
#63 folder-onboarding i18n). The `med`/`low` tickets (T15.9–T15.16) remain open
as backlog — out of scope for this pass.

## Milestone 16: AnkiDroid runtime-grant fix (T9.1, finally)

**Objective:** "Send to Anki" actually works against a current AnkiDroid install. The export throws
`Permission not granted for: CardContentProvider.query /decks (com.rivendell.app)` on the very first
content-provider call. Root cause is concrete and verified: `AnkiGateway.kt` calls
`api.deckList` / `api.modelList` (content-provider queries) **without ever driving AnkiDroid's runtime
permission grant**. On modern AnkiDroid, access requires the `READ_WRITE_PERMISSION`
(`AddContentApi.READ_WRITE_PERMISSION`) runtime grant — which Rivendell never requests. The bundled
`api-1.1.0.aar` already exports the symbols this needs (`READ_WRITE_PERMISSION`,
`getAnkiDroidPackageName`, `shouldRequestPermission` is *not* on the AAR — see T16.1); **no AAR swap
or manifest patch is the fix** — the missing piece is the runtime request flow itself. This is the
canonical flow the official `ankidroid/apisample` ships, ported to Rivendell's channel architecture.

> **Note on AnkiDroid 2.24+:** the runtime `ActivityCompat.requestPermissions({READ_WRITE_PERMISSION})`
> call is still the correct API. On 2.24 the user must additionally have AnkiDroid's global
> "Enable AnkiDroid API" toggle ON for the grant to succeed; when it's off the request returns DENIED
> and Rivendell surfaces a current-copy CTA (T16.3) — *not* the stale "Settings → Advanced → API →
> allow Rivendell" guidance PR #41 shipped.

### User stories
* As a learner, I want "Send to Anki" to succeed against my AnkiDroid install without a manual
  permission dance, or to tell me exactly what to flip if it can't.

### Acceptance criteria
* Tapping "Send to Anki" on a recording's word log, on a device with AnkiDroid installed + its API
  enabled, completes the export (Type 1 + Type 2 notes land in the Rivendell deck) with **no**
  `CardContentProvider.query /decks` SecurityException.
* On first export, if the runtime grant is missing, the user gets a one-time prompt that drives
  AnkiDroid's native grant screen; after granting, the export proceeds automatically (no second tap).
* If AnkiDroid is missing → "Install AnkiDroid" CTA (Play Store). If the grant is denied or the
  AnkiDroid API toggle is off → a clear snackbar/dialog with **current** copy: "Open AnkiDroid →
  Settings → enable the AnkiDroid API, then retry." No stale per-app-permission wording.
* Repeated exports never re-prompt once granted; the grant state is read via the API, not cached.

### Tickets
- **T16.1 — Kotlin gateway: permission API + install detection.** In
  `app/android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/rivendell/app/AnkiGateway.kt`:
  - Add `fun shouldRequestPermission(): Boolean` = API ≥ M and
    `ContextCompat.checkSelfPermission(context, AddContentApi.READ_WRITE_PERMISSION) != GRANTED`
    (this is `AnkiDroidHelper.shouldRequestPermission` from the apisample — reimplement inline; the
    `api-1.1.0.aar` does **not** ship `shouldRequestPermission` on `AddContentApi`, so don't call a
    missing method — use the `ContextCompat` check against the `READ_WRITE_PERMISSION` constant, which
    the AAR does export).
  - Switch `isInstalled()` from the `packageManager.getPackageInfo` probe to
    `AddContentApi.getAnkiDroidPackageName(context) != null` (canonical, also false when the user has
    disabled the API).
  - (No change to `ensureDeck`/`ensureModel`/`addNote`/`addMedia` — they're correct once the grant
    lands. Optional later: adopt `findDeckIdByName`/`findModelIdByName`-style rename-resilient lookup
    to cut content-provider round-trips — out of scope here.)
  - In `AndroidManifest.xml` ensure `<uses-permission android:name="<READ_WRITE_PERMISSION string>"/>`
    is declared (the permission is defined by AnkiDroid; the manifest declares that this app holds it,
    which the runtime request then grants). Use the `AddContentApi.READ_WRITE_PERMISSION` value verbatim.
  *ACs:* M16 AC 1. *Deps:* T4.1. ✅ PR #64 — `shouldRequestPermission()` reimplemented inline
  (API ≥ M + `ContextCompat.checkSelfPermission` vs `AddContentApi.READ_WRITE_PERMISSION`, verified
  via `javap` that the v1.1.0 aar exports the constant but not the method); `isInstalled()` switched
  to `getAnkiDroidPackageName(context) != null`; manifest comment refreshed (permission already
  declared by #41).
- **T16.2 — Channel + MainActivity runtime-grant flow.** In `MainActivity.kt`, add two
  `rivendell/anki` channel methods:
  - `"shouldRequestPermission"` → `result.success(ankiGateway.shouldRequestPermission())`.
  - `"requestPermission"` → register an `ActivityResultLauncher<String>` via
    `registerForActivityResult(ActivityResultContracts.RequestPermission())` (the modern, lifecycle-safe
    equivalent of `ActivityCompat.requestPermissions` + `onRequestPermissionsResult`; matches the SAF
    launcher pattern already in this file). Stash the `MethodChannel.Result` in a `pendingPermissionResult`
    field (mirror `pendingResult`/`pendingPickResult`), launch the contract with
    `READ_WRITE_PERMISSION`, and on the result callback `result.success(granted)` (and clear the
    pending field). Guard re-entry like the other launchers.
  Keep the existing `SecurityException` → `ANKI_NO_ACCESS` catch as a defensive backstop, but the
  front-door `shouldRequestPermission`/`requestPermission` is now the primary path. *ACs:* M16 AC 2.
  *Deps:* T16.1. ✅ PR #64 — `requestPermissionLauncher` via `registerForActivityResult(RequestPermission())`
  mirroring the SAF/image launchers, `pendingPermissionResult` + `REENTRY` guard, both methods handled
  on the main thread before the worker-thread content-provider block. `ANKI_NO_ACCESS` backstop retained.
  Bundled with T16.1 (one atomic native unit).
- **T16.3 — Dart export gate + one-time grant dialog + current copy.**
  - `AnkiGateway` interface (`features/anki/application/anki_gateway.dart`) +
    `AnkiDroidGatewayService` (`features/anki/platform/ankidroid_gateway_service.dart`): add
    `Future<bool> shouldRequestPermission()` + `Future<bool> requestPermission()` wrapping the two new
    channel methods. (`FakeAnkiGateway` gets no-op stubs returning `false`/`true`.)
  - Export flow (`anki_export_button.dart` + `anki_export_providers.dart`): before
    `exportType1`/`exportType2`, gate on access:
    1. `isInstalled()` false → show "Install AnkiDroid" dialog (Play Store deep link
       `market://details?id=com.ichi2.anki` with an http fallback). Return.
    2. `shouldRequestPermission()` true → show a one-time explainer dialog ("Rivendell needs AnkiDroid
       API access to add cards. Tap Continue to grant."), Continue → `requestPermission()`.
       Granted → proceed with the export. Denied → snackbar with current copy ("Open AnkiDroid →
       Settings → enable the AnkiDroid API, then retry.") and return.
    3. Else → proceed with the export (existing path).
  - Update ALL user-facing strings in `app/lib/l10n/` (en + templates) so nothing references the stale
    per-app permission screen or "Advanced → API" path. Add a `ankiEnableApiHint` string.
  - Handle the `ANKI_NO_ACCESS` typed error on existing calls as a fallback that re-runs the gate.
  Widget tests: faked gateway exercising the three branches (notInstalled / needsPermission-granted /
  needsPermission-denied) assert the right dialog/snackbar/export path. *ACs:* M16 AC 1–4. *Deps:*
  T16.2, T4.5. ✅ PR #65 — gateway/service/fake gain both methods (configurable stubs + call counter);
  `_send()` runs the 3-branch gate; `ANKI_NO_ACCESS` re-runs the gate once; stale
  `_looksLikePermissionError` text-sniff removed; l10n swapped stale `ankiPermissionHint` for
  `ankiEnableApiHint` + grant-dialog strings (en + uz). **Deviation:** the Play Store deep-link CTA was
  deferred (no `url_launcher` dep — would be a new platform channel); the existing "Install AnkiDroid
  from Google Play" dialog copy stays. Busy phase moved off the gate path into `_doExport` to stop the
  `CircularProgressIndicator` ticker deadlocking `pumpAndSettle` across the dialog await. 514 tests
  (+8), 91.2%, android auto-skipped.

**Milestone 16 COMPLETE (pending device-confirm).** All three tickets shipped (T16.1+T16.2 bundled as
PR #64, T16.3 as PR #65). The runtime-grant flow that the v1.1.0 aar exposed but Rivendell never drove
is now wired end-to-end: the export gates on `shouldRequestPermission`, drives AnkiDroid's native grant
screen via `registerForActivityResult(RequestPermission())`, and surfaces current copy on deny. The
`ankidroid_api_model` memory flagged a v2-aar migration as required; verified via `javap` that the
v1.1.0 aar already exports `READ_WRITE_PERMISSION` + `getAnkiDroidPackageName`, so no swap was needed —
the missing piece was the runtime request flow itself. **Device-confirm remains the unblockable
caveat** (mirrors T14.4/T14.5): on AnkiDroid 2.24 with the global API toggle ON, the first "Send to
Anki" should complete with no `CardContentProvider.query` SecurityException; with the toggle OFF, the
request returns DENIED and the enable-API snackbar shows current copy.
